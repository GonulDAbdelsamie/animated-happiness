Cooking is a lifestyle. We all know that any usual woman is not that usual at all as she is managing so many multi-tasking each and everyday.
So when we have a little bit closer look, its not hard to find out: Women are chefs, heroes... Love! Even if you are preparing a sandwich for your son just before the school, thats enough to be your own family cook!
You are not alone, you are just one of billion hidden chefs! So thank you, for being there and cooking for people who need your help... 
Keep up the good work and dont forget to enjoy your yourself&a cup of coffee in the end of the day!
